# Forkwell Coronavirus Hack: Drug Discovery

[Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository to start participating!

## About

Welcome to [Forkwell Coronavirus Hack](https://www.forkwell.io/events/forkwell-coronavirus-hack)!

This repository contains the hackathon kit for you to get started on solving **topic 1: Drug
Discovery** and eventually a place where you host all your submission artifacts as your own fork.

## Background

A few studies have shown that HIV antivirals offer promising results, but this is still an open
field of discovery.

Finding a new drug or validating an existing drug are both suitable approaches, we will be donating
samples of the winning compound to the Ministry of Health Malaysia for further analysis.

## Goal

Find a candidate drug (ligand) with a high binding affinity with the COVID-19 main protease.

1. Use machine learning to identify a potential candidate, then use docking software to get the
   binding affinity between it and the main protease.
2. Write a report that describes your process and results in detail in the form of a jupyter
   notebook.

## Submission

You are required to submit a 15-minute presentation video of your report. However, to ensure the
legitimacy of your submission, you are required to submit your project artifacts (code, datasets,
documents) as a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to this repository.

After creating your own [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
of this repository, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/fch-drug-discovery
```

Change to the directory:

```sh
cd fch-drug-discovery
```

Set upstream:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:forkwell-io/fch-drug-discovery
```

...and start Hacking!!

Once you are ready to submit, create a pull request from your
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to us and submit your submission form here,
we'll take care of the rest.

Please remember that your code will be publicly available, open-sourced licesed and free for the
internet to use. Please ensure that you don't commit any sensitive information!
